After elaborate inspect on the digital files with many profession tools, we get a conclusion that white rose is possibly not the very murderer. 
There are reasons as followed. 
Firstly, We do found white rose sshed into the victim's computer, however no evidence shows that rose put the suicide.doc to cover the murder. 
Secondly, Rose planned to leave at 10 PM the day victim got murdered, and victim was about to die at around 11 PM that day. So there are not enough evidence to accuse her as murderer.
